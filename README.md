### Dynamic Pricing Revenue Management Syllabus

IEOR E4601: Dynamic Pricing and Revenue Management
Instructor: Van Anh Truong, vatruong@ieor.columbia.edu

### Description.

The field of Revenue Management (RM) deals with selling a product at
the right price, at the right time to the right person. Many
industries use revenue management tools to maximize the return on
their limited supply of products. Airlines use revenue management to
decide what fare classes should remain open and what fare classes
should be closed. Hotels use revenue management to choose the room
rates and to decide how much to overbook. Revenue management is
increasingly important in retail, telecommunications, entertainment,
financial services, health care, manufacturing, as well as on-line
advertising, online retailing, and online markets. In parallel,
pricing and revenue optimization has become a rapidly expanding
practice in consulting services, and a growing area of software and IT
development. The goals of the course are the following.

1. Introduce the state-of-the art in the theory and practice of
revenue management in the context of different applications.

2. Learn about quantitative models that capture consumer behavior and
market uncertainty that are key ingredients for revenue management
problems

3. Help each student develop his or her own intuition about the
advantages and limitations of the models and how these approaches
can be adapted in a particular real-world problem. Prerequisites.
Probability and Statistics (IEOR E4150), Optimization Models and
Methods (IEOR E4004).

++ Organization and Grading

Homeworks. Homeworks must be individual work and submitted at the
start of the session it is due. Students may discuss homework
exercises with others but no person should rely on a written solution
of a homework exercise, even if one is available.

Midterm and Final. The course will have a midterm and a final exam.
Midterm will be held in class. The date for the Final will be
determined by the Registrar.

The grade will be assigned using the following weights.

1. Homeworks: 25%
2. Midterm: 30%
3. Final: 40%
